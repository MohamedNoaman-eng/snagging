  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/logo-one.png
    - assets/images/
    - assets/json/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Inter
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/inter/Inter-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/inter/Inter-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 600
        - asset: assets/fonts/inter/Inter-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/fonts/inter/Inter-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: assets/fonts/inter/Inter-Light.ttf
          weight: 300

    - family: Poppins
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/poppins/Poppins-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/poppins/Poppins-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 600
        - asset: assets/fonts/poppins/Poppins-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/fonts/poppins/Poppins-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: assets/fonts/poppins/Poppins-Light.ttf
          weight: 300
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
